This document is roughly a reflection of what is actually implemented.
It is updated as things are added, but note that it's updated before the change
is made to the code. Thus it may list a few things that are not implemented yet.
These things *should* be marked with "TODO", but may not be.


### General Syntax ###

eol = ":" | "\n" | EOF

statement = (class | function | sub | dim | assignment | subCall | call | exit) eol

class = "class" identifier eol classDecl* "end" "class"
classDecl = (dim | function | sub) eol

function = "function" identifier ("(" args ")")? eol statements "end" "function"
sub = "sub" identifier ("(" args ")")? eol statements "end" "sub"
dim = "dim" identifier ("(" integer ")")? ("," identifier ("(" integer ")")?)* # TODO

argList = argListArg "," argList | argListArg
argListArg = identifier

assignment = lvalue "=" expr
lvalue = variable | funcCall
set = "set" assignment

funcCall = variable "(" args ")"
args = expr | expr "," args
call = "call" variable "(" args ")"

subCall = variable args

exit = "exit" ("function" | "sub") # TODO


identifier = IDENTIFIER

if = "if" expr "then" eol statements ("elseif" condition  "then" eol statements)* ("else" eol statements)? "end" "if"

statements = statement*

variable = identifier | identifier "." variable

new = "new" variable    # TODO: should this simply be identifier?


### Literals ###

string = "\"" stringChar* "\""
stringChar = . | ("\"\"" -> "\"")
